Hi, thanks for offering to help with this.

I am building a real-life WALL-E according to this:
* https://wired.chillibasket.com/3d-printed-wall-e/
* https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3703555

I am building it 5/3 scaled up from the original version, 
and I'm using a stronger motor:
https://www.servocity.com/5202-series-yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motor-26-9-1-ratio-24mm-length-6mm-d-shaft-223-rpm-36mm-gearbox-3-3-5v-encoder/

I need to adjust the motor brackets so that the axle and screw holes 
are still in the same location, but the circular motor bracket fits 
the new motor (it's the same diameter, but it's longer. Because of the
5/3 scaling, it is too small if you scale up the bracket directly.)

In this zip there are the source .step files, which means that the 
brackets are UNSCALED!!! So you need to scale them up by 5/3 if you're
using a different software. There's also a Solidworks part which is scaled
up. I also included the motor .step file and converted to Solidworks part.
If at doubt, confer the links above or message me.

Again: the axle and screw locations should stay the same. Assume I've just 
taken all the models and scaled them up by 5/3 (which is basically what I
did +- some other adjustments).

You can send me this same zip file with the modified parts.

Thanks
