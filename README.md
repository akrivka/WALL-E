# WALL-E

![](media/photos/IMG_7303.jpg)

For Blacker Hovse Ditch Day 2024 (Caltech tradition), we built a ~70% "real-life" size WALL-E robot, that could be **driven remotely with a PS5 controller, move his head and arms, record and transmit a video feed, speak (faintly)**, and he even had a small storage space in his body (for trash of course!).

Here's my video of him when he was at his best (he's currently sitting in a closet in Blacker to be used as a static showcase project, while I study over in Switzerland...):

The model we used was https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3703555, but we scaled it up by 5/3 which introduced a bunch of challenges.
